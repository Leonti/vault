<p><strong>Vault</strong> is a small web application which you can run on your own server which stores your sensitive data in s single encrypted file and provides web interface to view and edit it.  </p>

<h4>
<a id="the-why" class="anchor" href="#the-why" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The why</h4>

<p>I wanted something to store my passwords and notes in a secure way which could be accessible both online/offline and from my Android mobile. I wasn't satisfied with services like LastPass because they are not comfortable to work with passwords other than web ones and I need to store my ssh passwords and keys somewhere. I would like to be able to access my data offline from a file without an internet connection.<br>
Also I already have a server running, so why not build something fun and run it for free?</p>

<h4>
<a id="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How it works</h4>

<p>Your data is stored in AES-256 encrypted file in your private S3 bucket.<br>
Web application written in Python uses a password you provide over <em>https</em> connection to decrypt the data and present it to you in the browser window.  </p>

<h4>
<a id="what-you-need" class="anchor" href="#what-you-need" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What you need</h4>

<ul>
<li>A server to run the web application. Docker support is not mandatory but it makes the whole thing a lot easier </li>
<li>Amazon S3 bucket to store files</li>
<li>A domain name and a certificate for it. I use cheap-ass domain validated certificate. Self-signed one would also work.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<a id="how-secure-it-is" class="anchor" href="#how-secure-it-is" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How secure it is?</h4>

<ul>
<li>Data between your browser and your server is protected by <em>https</em>
</li>
<li>Only sha-256 salted hash is stored on your server</li>
<li>The data itself is encrypted using AES-256 encryption, so getting an access to the file from S3 would also not pose a huge security risk<br>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<a id="demo" class="anchor" href="#demo" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Demo</h4>

<p>Here you can see a demo of the UI (data is stored in your browser session) <a href="http://leonti.github.io/vault/demo">Demo</a><br>
Any password will do :)  </p>

<h4>
<a id="how-to-install" class="anchor" href="#how-to-install" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to install</h4>

<p>Build docker image:<br>
<code>sudo docker build -t leonti/vault .</code>  </p>

<p>Generate configuration file:<br>
<code>sudo docker run -v /data:/data -e SETTINGS=/data/settings.cfg -t -i leonti/vault python generate_config.py</code><br>
You will have to provide your S3 config and your master password.  </p>

<p>Run the whole thing:<br>
<code>sudo docker run -v /data:/data -e SETTINGS=/data/settings.cfg --name vault -t -i leonti/vault python vault.py</code>  </p>

<p>After that you have to run a docker nginx instance with domain and ssl configuration, and link <code>vault</code> container to it.  </p>

<p>Since everything is stored in a single file you can download it from <code>/download</code> url. This allows you to back up the file wherever you want - on your disk, usb drive, etc.<br>
It can be decrypted on your machine using:<br>
<code>openssl aes-256-cbc -d -a -in vault.db -out vault.dec</code>  </p>
