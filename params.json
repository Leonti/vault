{"name":"Vault","tagline":"Vault - personal online password and secure notes manager","body":"###Vault - personal online password manager with notes\r\n**Vault** is a small web application which you can run on your own server which stores your sensitive data in s single encrypted file and provides web interface to view and edit it.  \r\n\r\n####The why\r\nI wanted something to store my passwords and notes in a secure way which could be accessible both online/offline and from my Android mobile. I wasn't satisfied with services like LastPass because they are not comfortable to work with passwords other than web ones and I need to store my ssh passwords and keys somewhere. I would like to be able to access my data offline from a file without an internet connection.  \r\nAlso I already have a server running, so why not build something fun and run it for free?\r\n\r\n####How it works  \r\nYour data is stored in AES-256 encrypted file in your private S3 bucket.  \r\nWeb application written in Python uses a password you provide over *https* connection to decrypt the data and present it to you in the browser window.  \r\n\r\n####What you need\r\n* A server to run the web application. Docker support is not mandatory but it makes the whole thing a lot easier \r\n* Amazon S3 bucket to store files\r\n* A domain name and a certificate for it. I use cheap-ass domain validated certificate. Self-signed one would also work.\r\n\r\n####How secure it is?\r\n* Data between your browser and your server is protected by *https*\r\n* Only sha-256 salted hash is stored on your server\r\n* The data itself is encrypted using AES-256 encryption, so getting an access to the file from S3 would also not pose a huge security risk  \r\n\r\n####How to install  \r\n\r\nBuild docker image:  \r\n`sudo docker build -t leonti/vault .`  \r\n\r\nGenerate configuration file:  \r\n`sudo docker run -v /data:/data -e SETTINGS=/data/settings.cfg -t -i leonti/vault python generate_config.py`  \r\nYou will have to provide your S3 config and your master password.  \r\n\r\nRun the whole thing:  \r\n`sudo docker run -v /data:/data -e SETTINGS=/data/settings.cfg --name vault -t -i leonti/vault python vault.py`  \r\n\r\nAfter that you have to run a docker nginx instance with domain and ssl configuration, and link `vault` container to it.  \r\n\r\nSince everything is stored in a single file you can download it from `/download` url. This allows you to back up the file wherever you want - on your disk, usb drive, etc.  \r\nIt can be decrypted on your machine using:    \r\n`openssl aes-256-cbc -d -a -in vault.db -out vault.dec`  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
